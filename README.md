NC Online Document - We would like to create an online document system that would be filled out by both programmers and machine operators. The system should  reside on the server with  access and ease of use by all parties and different user levels. I have personally made the document (in lifecycle designer by Adobe ) that is about 60% completed that would serve as a starting point to see whatâ€™s needed.
